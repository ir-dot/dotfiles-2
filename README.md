# Dot files

Since a week before this commit I've been enjoying i3 and I don't think I'm ever going back to gnome or KDE. As that's the case, I need to preserve the my config!

## Requirements
- i3, of course!
- i3-gaps
- compton
- betterlockscreen
- i3lock-color
- polybar
- rofi
- feh
- redshift
- jq

**FONT**: Go to [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) and generate a font containing all Feather icons just to be safe. It's free as well as the other dependencies. You can use Icomoon to generate fonts containing any icons you want and use their glyphs any where you like. All install FontAwesome, Fira Code and maybe Source Code Pro (Amazing font for coding. Fira Code is great for coding too but I use it mostly for the polybar and split titles).

**TOKENS**: Store your tokens inside `$HOME/.tokens` and they will be accessed from the scripts.
